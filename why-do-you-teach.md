#  Why do you teach?

> 👦 "Be who you needed when you were younger."

Learning to code has been really tough for me. I've spent years figuring everything out,
and I'm still trying/struggling to. I'm just trying to be the person I needed when I was a
teenager and starting out.

> 🔥 "Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel."

I've always wanted to be a role model, inspire and motivate others to go after their
dreams and goals. I truly love what I do. I enjoy programming and computer science and
want to share my passion with others, inspire them to learn more, go further, dig deeper.
I want to spark your curiosity.

live its whole life believing that it is stupid."

I believe that everybody is capable of learning to code, no matter what you previous
background is. It is just a matter of an individual approach. Everybody is unique, so the
learning process should be tailored specifically to you.

a lifetime."

A lot of modern teaching that I've encountered is focused on "feeding the man", by which I
mean just giving you the commands or solution for the problem at hand, without teaching
you how to come up with it yourself and how to solve similar problems in the future. I
want to change that, I want you to become independent as a developer as fast as possible,
so instead of teaching you the concrete solutions, I teach you how to critically think and
approach the problem.

> 🧠 "Teaching is the highest form of understanding."

Teaching challenges me every time I'm explaining something, and I like this challenge, it
makes me learn more, revisit the basics more and gain a deeper understanding of the art of
programming. It makes me a better software developer and person as a whole. So I benefit a
lot from it. Explaining something you've learned to somebody else really makes it stick in
your head. For me, the best way to learn something and make sure I truly understood it -
is to try to teach it to another person.

> 🕯 "A good teacher is like a candle - it consumes itself to light the way for others."

I think that teaching is a noble profession, shaping the minds of the future developers is
a huge responsibility and it makes me feel proud that I'm doing that.

My students inspire me to keep "fighting" and going after my dreams and vision. When I
feel down and like giving up, teaching helps me push through such times.

Teaching is humbling. It makes you remember where you started and how far you've gotten
along your journey.
